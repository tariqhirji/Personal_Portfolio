# Personal_Portfolio

This is a personal website that I created for myself to showcase my work. 
It is currently a work in progress, where the layout will be finished, and functionality through JS and other languages will be added in different Github branches once I begin to work on them.

I will keep this portfolio up to date with my latest projects and continiously update my relevant information, with the possibility of keeping older versions to see the change over time. 

Some ideas that I would like to incorporate onto the website are:
- Changing navbar colour based on where it is on the page (with transitions)
- Rotating text animation
- Rotating skills cards in section when reaching "SKILLS"
- Projects appear as your scroll down.
- Both Computer science and General resume available (with sensitive information blacked out)
